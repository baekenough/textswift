# [MUST] Continuous Improvement Rules

> **Priority**: MUST | **ID**: R016 | **Trigger**: User points out rule violation

## Core Rule

When user points out a violation: STOP → UPDATE the relevant rule → COMMIT → THEN continue original task.

Do NOT just apologize. ACTUALLY UPDATE THE RULES.

## Workflow

1. Acknowledge violation
2. Identify root cause (which rule was weak/unclear?)
3. Update the rule (add clarity, examples, self-checks)
4. Commit the change
5. Continue original task following updated rules

## Integration

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User points out violation | STOP → Update rule → Continue |
| Self-detected violation | Fix immediately, consider rule update |
| Ambiguous situation | Ask user, then update if needed |
